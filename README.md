Background

The motivation for this project came from realizing a need within this small business to streamline data collection and visualization.  Prior to this project, data was pulled off individual tabs within the sales and event management platform and manually entered to make visualizations.  The goal was to make this process much leaner and more efficient while also presenting this small business with different ways of analyzing their data that was not previously available to them.  Allowing different, more complex questions to be asked and answered.

Data Questions

When do clients inquire about booking an event for a certain month?  Out of those clients, how many of those clients end up booking an event?  What is the total revenue per month per restaurant location based on event type?  Based on previous years inquiry data, when should the business increase marketing and outreach efforts for a certain month?
